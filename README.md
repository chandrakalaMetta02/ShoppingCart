The Implementation
Implement the front end functionality for “The Shopping Cart” which displays different product and each product would be under a category. 
Each product has a Price associated to it.
Primary features of a shopping cart are expected to be implemented. 

Primary Features (must be implemented)
User should be able to view all items under a category. 
User should be able to select a particular product, add it to shopping cart.
User should be able to check out the cart once they are done with the selection of products.
Checking out the cart would display all the products, category, price in the cart along with the total amount in a soft popup.
On confirmation of the cart details by the player, a receipt should be displayed with the products in the cart and the invoice number which can be any random number.
 
Secondary Features (if time allows)
User should be able to edit or delete items from the cart.
User should be able to filter items by categories, price range e.g (less than $5, $5 - $10, $10 - $15, $15 - $20, over $20). 
User should be able to sort items by price range e.g High to Low, Low to High 
If the Total Price of cart exceeds $50, a flat 10% should be applied on the total cart price.
